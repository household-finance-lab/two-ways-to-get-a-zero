*  Response behavior under uncertainty and an implausible investment proposition
*
*  DATA   : 2024 NFCS Investor Survey (n = 2,861) + 2024 NFCS State-by-State
*           Stata .dta files as distributed
*  OUTCOME: G43 — guaranteed, risk-free 25% annual return for 5 years
*  DESIGN : EXPLORATORY. The expectation below is a post-hoc formalization of a
*           result already known from prior work. It is NOT confirmatory and is
*           never to be relabeled as such.
*
*  RQ1: Among investors with comparable levels of objective investment
*  knowledge, is the tendency to respond "Don't know" rather than answer
*  incorrectly associated with acceptance of an implausible high-return,
*  no-risk investment proposition?
*
*  H1: Holding the number of correct investment-knowledge responses constant, a
*  greater number of "Don't know" responses will be associated with a lower
*  probability of accepting an investment proposition promising a guaranteed,
*  risk-free 25% annual return.
*
*  H1 is an EXPLORATORY expectation, formalized after the result was already
*  known from prior work. The H-label is notation, not a claim of
*  prespecification, and the repository must say so wherever H1 appears.
*
*  OPERATIONALIZATION
*    objective knowledge ........ n_correct
*    DK rather than incorrect ... n_dk, conditional on n_correct
*    investment proposition ..... G43
*    covariates ................. age, education, income, gender, ethnicity

* --- String columns -----------------------------------------------------------
* In the CSV distribution, 44 columns carry a space where a question was skipped
* by design, which forces the column to import as text. The .dta distribution
* usually resolves this, so this block is defensive: it converts only if
* something arrives as a string, and reports what it touched.
*
*** DECISION A1: destring with force on any string column.
*   Every column in these files is numerically coded, so the only values that
*   cannot convert are design skips, which SHOULD become missing.
*   Alternative: hand-convert a named list. Rejected — the list rots silently if
*   FINRA changes skip patterns in a later wave.

* are student-loan checkboxes here and reasons-for-investing items there.
* Suffixing the whole block catches collisions nobody has noticed yet and makes
* provenance visible in every later line of code.
*
*** DECISION A2: suffix ALL State-by-State variables with _sbs.
*   Alternative: rename only the six known collisions. Rejected — a missed
*   collision runs cleanly and means nothing, which is the worst failure mode.

* WGT1 is the Investor Survey weight, documented as weighting by age and

*
* wgt_n2 is a NATIONAL weight built for the full 25,539-respondent State sample.
* Applying it here would ignore the subsampling entirely: 8,933 screened yes on
* B14A_1 but only 2,861 completed the Investor Survey, and WGT1 is what carries
* that correction. The State weights are dropped rather than left in the file to
* be picked up by accident.
*
*** DECISION A3: WGT1 for all estimation; State weights dropped from the file.
*
* NOTE for the write-up: WGT1 post-stratifies on age and education only. Sex,
* income, and ethnicity are UNADJUSTED in every weighted estimate below. That
* bears directly on the gender heterogeneity analysis in C6 and on how far the
* ethnicity coefficient can be read in C2.

svyset [pweight = wgt1]

* What svyset buys us here, and what it does not. FINRA does not release primary
* sampling units or strata for this file, so this declaration handles the weights
* and produces design-consistent standard errors under a with-replacement
* assumption. It does not recover a clustered design we have no information
* about. State that limitation rather than implying a fuller design was modeled.

*------------------------------------------------------------------------------*
* A5. Demographics
*------------------------------------------------------------------------------*
* The Investor file already carries demographics copied from the State survey:
*   S_Gender2   1 Male, 2 Female
*   S_Age       1 18-34, 2 35-54, 3 55+      <- exactly FINRA's published bands
*   S_Education 1 some college or less, 2 college grad or more
*   S_Income    1 <$50K, 2 $50K-$100K, 3 $100K+
*   S_Ethnicity 1 White non-Hispanic, 2 Non-White
*
* Verified against the merged State variables: agreement is 1.00 on sex (A50A),
* age (A3Ar_w collapsed to three bands) and education (A5_2015 collapsed at
* bachelor's), with no missing values.
*
*** DECISION A4: primary models use the S_* variables.
*   Alternative: the finer State-side variables (a3ar_w 6 bands, a5_2015 7
*   categories, a8_2021 10 brackets), retained in the merged file and used as a
*   robustness check in C5. The coarse versions are primary because they match
*   the bands FINRA validates against and are less likely to produce empty cells
*   in the interaction models.

*   G8  20-year best returns ..... 1  (stocks)                          5 options

*   G11 municipal bonds .......... 3  (can be tax-free)                 3 options
*   G12 margin loss .............. 3  ($0)                              3 options

*** DECISION B1: n_incorrect is STRICT — refusals excluded, not folded in.

*------------------------------------------------------------------------------*
*** DECISION B2: the gate runs on the FULL n = 2,861, before the analytic sample

*   Tested both ways. On the full sample every published figure reproduces. On
*   the refusal-dropped sample the female mean rises to 4.59 (rounds to 4.6
*   against a published 4.5) and G40 becomes 5.63/5.28 against a published
*   5.6/5.2. Gating on the analytic sample would fire a failure at a correctly
*   built pipeline. The gate asks "did we reproduce the published numbers"; the
*   sample rule asks "which respondents can support our estimates". Different
*   questions, asked in that order.

* B9. General non-quiz DK propensity
*------------------------------------------------------------------------------*
* NAMING MATTERS HERE, and the earlier name overclaimed. This is NOT a validated
* response-style scale. Several of its items involve genuine substantive
* uncertainty about one's own finances — whether an account permits margin or
* options, which fees are paid, whether disclosures were received, whether one
* was targeted by fraud. A "don't know" there may mean "I do not know this fact
* about my own accounts" rather than any habit of clicking DK.
*
* So the index measures one thing only: how often this respondent selected DK on
* non-quiz Investor Survey items. The analysis it supports is correspondingly
* narrow — whether the quiz-DK association survives adjustment for a
* respondent's broader propensity to select DK elsewhere in the same instrument.
* Do not write "response style" or "satisficing" off this variable.
*
* Construction rules:
*   1. G43 is NOT among the items. Including the outcome inside a control would
*      guarantee an association and prove nothing. Asserted below, not assumed.
*   2. The 11 quiz items are excluded — they are the predictor.
*   3. G2, G40, G41 excluded — they enter models elsewhere.
*   4. Only universally-asked items. Items behind a skip pattern (B6, B34,
*      B24-B26, C41-C43, D42, E3, E4) would give respondents different
*      denominators, so the index would partly measure how many questions
*      someone was shown.
*   5. H40 is not present in this file and has been removed from the list.
*
*** DECISION C2: index built from 30 universally-asked non-quiz items.
*   Alternative: include skip-pattern items for a longer index. Rejected — a
*   varying denominator makes the index non-comparable across respondents.
*   Second alternative: add the F30 reliance and F31 platform batteries (22 more
*   universally-asked items). Not taken, to keep the index close to the earlier
*   26-item version.
*   ACTION: reconcile this list against the earlier 26-item index. If they
*   differ, recompute the earlier result on whichever list is kept rather than
*   reporting the two as interchangeable.

* B10. Analytic sample rule
*------------------------------------------------------------------------------*
*** DECISION B3: drop any respondent with at least one refusal on the 11 items.
*   n_incorrect is derived by subtraction, so an unremoved refusal is silently
*   absorbed into the incorrect tally and breaks the sum-to-11 identity the
*   specification rests on.
*   Alternative (keep them, folding refusals into incorrect) is executed in C5b.
